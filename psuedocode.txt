// PSEUDO CODE TEMPLATE TAKEN FROM ELLIE

// ========= BREW WORK

an app designed to make traditional herbal healing and medicine more accessible and easier to understand.  

Users can search a database of herbs / natural ingredients and put together recipes right in the app based on their unique properties and flavor profiles. 

They can also keep a record of the progress of their symptoms, or how they are improving, and also have the option to take a fun, interactive survey that leads them through a “foraging” journey to create their own pre-made combinations for their discomfort or desired self-improvement.


=========== //


========================= /////// wire framing —> 


/////////////// PAGES:

===== Landing page - The initial Brew Work page

===== Sign in/Sign up page - Where user can login or click the signup button and go to the signup page

===== User profile page - The Dashboard which shows: MONTHLY HEALING PROGRESS, TIMES I'VE BREWED, HERBS IN CABINET, BREW RECIPES SAVED, LENGTH OF HEALING JOURNEY

===== Foraging/Herb Discovery (with randomizer for herbs in the database) - A page with a survey to find a new herb that suits their needs.  Other side of the page will be a randomizer if user does not want to "go                 foraging".  Below this will be the CABINET WHERE THE HERBS ARE STORED AND APPEAR ONCE THEY ARE CHOSEN FROM THE FORAGING SURVEY/RANDOMIZER OPTION.

///// Apothecary cabinet (multiple parts) (added to bottom of ^^ foraging page) -
Users can open the cabinet and see their herbs displayed.  When they CLICK on the herb, the corresponding recipes you have created from that herb category will show up that you've already stored (i.e: you click on "lavender" and are shown "lavender rose tea", "lavender honey", "lavender aromatherapy smudge stick").


===== Progress Page - tracking progress page that displays: LENGTH OF DURATION OF WELLNESS JOURNEY // A COUNTER FOR HOW MANY TIMES USER HAS CREATED A NEW RECIPE // AN AREA WHERE USER CAN ENTER TEXT TO RECORD SYMPTOMS AND AN ABILITY TO CHOOSE FROM A SPECTRUM IF THEY FELT GOOD OR BAD THAT DAY AND AN ABILITY TO CHECK OFF IF THEY USED A REMEDY OR NOT // A GRAPH / CHART DISPLAYING THESE VALUES
